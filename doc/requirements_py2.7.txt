# Update considerations:
# - could update python packages
# - could switch to mod_wsgi-express (then can use Py3?)

# pip requirements file for HSNmail with a Python-2.7.13
# setuptools, pip, and virtualenv should already be present in the (virtual) python2.7
# the linux packages python-devel and mysql-devel were needed for installing mysqlclient
# install the packages below from a terminal; 
# newer versions may work; we used the versions below: 

# $ pip install -r requirements_py2.7.txt

future == 0.16.0
Django == 1.11.2
django_extensions == 1.8.0
django-registration == 2.2
mysqlclient == 1.3.12
pycups == 1.9.73				# requires cups-devel
python-ldap == 2.4.40			# requires openldap-devel
