Create a virtualenv Python-3.6.1

-1- Create a normal Python-3.6.1 from its source.
	Get Python-3.6.1 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361/
		$ tar -zxf Python-3.6.1.tgz
		$ cd Python-3.6.1
	Installation directory will be: ~/opt/Python/python-3.6.1
		$ export PYTHON_LOCAL=~/opt/Python/python-3.6.1 
		$ ./configure --prefix=$PYTHON_LOCAL
		...
		If you want a release build with all optimizations active (LTO, PGO, etc),
		please run ./configure --enable-optimizations

		$ make
		(in case make complains about a missing _lzma module you need to install xz & xz-devel)

		$ make altinstall		# alt: do not [try to] replace /usr/bin/python
		...
		Collecting setuptools
		Collecting pip
		Installing collected packages: setuptools, pip
		Successfully installed pip-9.0.1 setuptools-28.8.0

	Use it
		create a file ~/bin/python361 and use it
		$ source ~/bin/python361

	Notice
		the pip and easy_install (from setuptools) are versioned: 
			$PYTHON_LOCAL/bin/pip3.6
			$PYTHON_LOCAL/bin/easy_install-3.6
		of course we do not need to invoke easy_install-3.6 directly. 

-2- venv â€” Creation of virtual environments
	The built-in pyvenv is also versioned: $PYTHON_LOCAL/bin/pyvenv-3.6

	Notice
		the compiled python only has the versioned bin/pip3.6
		the venv pythons also get the unversioned bin/pip

-4- Create a virtualenv python for HSNmail somewhere, say in PROJECT
		$ cd $PROJECT
	use the created python
		$ source ~/bin/python361
	create a venv python; its top-level directory will be python361
		$ python3.6 -m venv python361
	use it
		$ source python361/bin/activate
	notice that your prompt is now prefixed with '(python361)'

-3- Add more packages with pip to the new python361 for your project
